				<p>This is a transparent and peer-reviewed project. We need you to get involved so that ToS;DR can take off! We're only at the very early stage of the process, so this is your opportunity to help: we want your feedback!</p>
				<ul>
					<li>If you want to contribute your analysis or comment on specific terms and points, then <strong>this guide is for you!</strong></li>
					<li>If you're a JavaScript developer, you can help with code on <a href="http://github.com/didnotread/didnotread.org">GitHub</a>, why not have a look at the <a href="http://github.com/didnotread/didnotread.org/issues">current issues</a>.</li>
					<li>Anyone can share their thoughts and subscribe to our public working group: <a href="https://groups.google.com/d/forum/tosdr">tosdr@googlegroups.com</a>. We especially welcome <strong>legal expertise</strong>, so law students feel free to state your views and get some experience on real life situations!&nbsp; 
					We use a Google group because they're easy to set up and have a good web interface. But you can also join by email to <a href="mailto:tosdr+subscribe@googlegroups.com">tosdr+subscribe@googlegroups.com</a> using your favourite email client.</li>
				
					<li>If you have any questions you can also contact us via IRC (the <a href="http://webchat.freenode.net/?channels=#tosdr">#tosdr irc channel on freenode</a>), or <a href="http://twitter.com/tosdr">twitter</a>, or contact Hugo or Michiel from the <a href="index.html#wthru">about section</a>.</li>

				<h1 class="page-header">How to contribute</h1>
				
				<p><strong>SHORT: Write an email to <a href="mailto:tosdr@googlegroups.com">tosdr@googlegroups.com</a> with a link to the terms, a small quote from the terms about the point you're making and let us know if you think it's a good or a bad point. It's better to do one email thread by topic, rather than one email per service. For more details, read on!</strong></p>
				
				<p>Each thread on our <a href="https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/tosdr">mailing list</a> is a data point that is waiting for you to join in the discussion. You can simply comment by replying to a thread if you think it is an important issue. If you have a link to some positive or negative news about how a website or service is treating us, or you have read something good or something bad in the Terms of Service of a website, you should contribute it to the mailing list as well.

				<p>So, if you are curious about a service's Terms or if you have information related to one service, we welcome your contributions. In this guide, we will use GitHub as an example. We hope they don't mind! We are not affiliated with them (although, we use their service).</p>
				<p>Now: how do we get…</p>
				
				<div class="row-fluid">
					<div class="span4">
						<p>From this…</p>
						<img height="400" src="img/example-tos-screen.png" style="box-shadow: 0 0 .5em #000;" alt="a screen shot" />
					</div>
			
					<div id="service-example" class="span8">
						<p>to this?</p>
                        <!-- ##github-service-content## -->
					</div>
				</div>
				
				<h2 class="page-header">1. Locate the Terms of Service and Privacy Policy</h2>
				<p>
					This might seem obvious to you, but sometimes it is not really made easy to find where the terms are.
					You can usually find them at the bottom of pages, typically as links like "Terms" and "Privacy". For anything you do, <strong>it is important that we are always able to redirect to the source</strong>. ToS;DR is never a substitute for really reading the terms and finding out for yourself.
				</p>
				
				<h3>Help us track changes to terms</h3>
				<p>
					We also want to be able to make an archive of the terms of service, so that we are able to track changes over time, and notify users who subscribe when something important is going on. The best thing to help with that is to contribute to Tosback. You can see a list of the current list of archived terms at <a href="https://github.com/pde/tosback2">https://github.com/pde/tosback2</a> in the <a href="https://github.com/pde/tosback2/tree/master/rules">rules/ directory</a>, if you see some are missing, or incorrect, please <a href="mailto:tosback2@eff.org">email to tosback2@eff.org</a>.
				</p>
				
				<h3>Were the terms accessible?</h3>
				<p>When you have found the terms, it is already important to assess the situation. We value services which make a priority of making their rules easily accessible to their users. If the terms are easy to read, if they have a summary before and if they have helpers and pointers to guide the users, this is definitely a positive aspect worth to be mentioned. On the contrary, if you think the user experience was obnoxious, it also deserves to be mentioned as a negative point.</p>
				
				<p><a href="http://wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Terms_of_use" target="_blank" class="btn">Wikipedia's Terms of Use: very easy to read »</a> <a href="topics.html#readability" class="btn">Other examples on readability »</a></p>
				
				<div class="our-example">
					<p>In our example with GitHub, each page has this at the bottom:</p>
					<blockquote>
						<a href="https://github.com/site/terms">Terms of Service</a>&nbsp; 
						<a href="https://github.com/site/privacy">Privacy</a>&nbsp; 
						<a href="https://github.com/security">Security</a>&nbsp; 
						<br />© 2012 <span title="0.07474s from fe13.rs.github.com">GitHub</span> Inc. All rights reserved.</p>
					</blockquote>
					<p>
						GitHub's Terms are already archived by Tosback. You can see the "rules" at <a href="https://github.com/pde/tosback2/blob/master/rules/github.com.xml">https://github.com/pde/tosback2/blob/master/rules/github.com.xml</a>. If you don't feel at ease writing XML documents, just <a href="mailto:tosback2@eff.org">email to tosback2@eff.org</a>
					</p>
				
				</div>
				
				<p><strong>Bonus:</strong> sometimes, you can have a look at the HTML source code of the terms of service pages, and you can see that each section has an "id" which you can use to point directly to a specific section! For example, SoundCloud does it: <a href="http://soundcloud.com/terms-of-use#acceptance">http://soundcloud.com/terms-of-use#acceptance</a>. As you can see, the index and the summaries are quite practical. We consider this good practice.  </p>
				
				<h2 class="page-header">2. Read the terms. Make annotations and comments.</h2>
				<p>Unfortunately, we have not developed tools to help you read through terms. Automated analysis is a difficult task, and while there are some projects working on this, such as <a href="http://commonterms.net">CommonTerms.net</a> to make that task easier, maybe a good old annotation tool can help.</p>
				<p>Reading a whole legal document can be cumbersome. You don't necessarily have to read the whole contract, you might also focus on specific aspects. For instance, you can report about <a href="topics.html#copyright-scope">how broad the copyright license is</a>, or <a href="topics.html#cookies">check out how the service uses cookies</a>. You can always <strong>look for inspiration about existing points <a href="topics.html">ordered by topics</a></strong>.</p>
				<p>It would be helpful if you can publish what you do. Allowing people to engage and review your analysis is very important. You can also start to use a public document to help you review and make annotations. Some people use Google Docs. We also have a Co-Ment platform at <a href="https://tosdr.co-ment.com">tosdr.co-ment.com</a>.
				</p>
				<p class="our-example">For GitHub, see <a href="https://tosdr.co-ment.com/text/wP4wQXB5Lev/view/">https://tosdr.co-ment.com/text/wP4wQXB5Lev/view/</a>. You can make annotations and comments, and engage in discussions.</p>
				<p>It is also a good idea to search forums, blogs and news about a particular service. You might find stories, complaints and comments about things you've  highlighted, or things you've missed.</p>
				
				<h2 class="page-header">3. Report "data points" to the working group</h2>
				<p>Now that you've got some ideas or arguments to make, we need to be able to discuss them and formulate them into data.</p>
				<p>Send an email or subscribe to <a href="https://groups.google.com/d/forum/tosdr">tosdr@googlegroups.com</a> with information about the topic or the subject of the point, it also helps to says if you think it's a good or a bad point, then give the source, ideally also give a quote from the source. Then give your opinion and wait for others to reply!</p>
				<p>It is better to start a new thread for a new point, or to contribute to an existing thread if the point has already been raised. Please do one thread per point rather than one thread per service.</p>
					<div class="our-example">
						<p>For example, you were reading GitHub and at some point you read "We claim no intellectual property rights". You saw on <a href="topics.html#copyright-scope">our topics page</a> that there is a topic called "copyright-scope". So you made an <a href="https://tosdr.co-ment.com/text/wP4wQXB5Lev/view/?comment_id_key=gIGhlNxIwqx">annotation on co-ment</a>. Now, you'd like to report to the group what you found out. First, make a quick search on the group to see if the service GitHub or if the specific point has not been raised already. If it has, please avoid duplicates and contribute to the original thread instead. Then, send an email — something like this: </p>
						<dl>
							<dt>Subject: </dt>
							<dd>(good point) GitHub doesn't ask for a copyright license</dd>
							
							<dt>Email:</dt>
							<dd>Hello everyone, <br />
							GitHub Terms of service at <a href="https://help.github.com/articles/github-terms-of-service">https://help.github.com/articles/github-terms-of-service</a> reads:
							<blockquote>We claim no intellectual property rights over the material you 
							provide to the Service. Your profile and materials uploaded 
							remain yours. However, by setting your pages to be viewed 
							publicly, you agree to allow others to view your Content. By 
							setting your repositories to be viewed publicly, you agree to 
							allow others to view and fork your repositories.</blockquote>
							I think it is a good thing that users don't grant any of their copyright to GitHub.
						</dl>
					</div>
					
					<p>You're done! Now, we will have a public discussion on the mailing-list about the point, and discuss, compare with other services, and then at last, we will probably write the point in a JSON file, published under the Creative Commons CC-BY-SA 3.0 license (<a href="legal.html#terms-contribution">read the Terms of Contribution</a>).</p>
					<div class="our-example">
						<p>In our example about GitHub's copyright scope, here's what the JSON file looks like:</p>
