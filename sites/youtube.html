YouTube hereby grants you permission to access and use the Service as set forth in these Terms of Service, provided that:

makes available the means for such distribution through functionality offered by the Service (such as the Embeddable Player).
 2. You agree not to alter or modify any part of the Service.
   3. You agree not to access Content through any technology or means other than the video playback pages of the Service itself, the Embeddable 
Player, or other explicitly authorized means YouTube may designate.
</span>

<span class="limited-commercial-uses">   

4. You agree not to use the Service for any of the following commercial uses unless you obtain YouTube's prior written approval:
          * the sale of access to the Service;
          * the sale of advertising, sponsorships, or promotions placed on or within the Service or Content; or
          * the sale of advertising, sponsorships, or promotions on any page of an ad-enabled blog or website containing Content delivered via the Service, unless other material not obtained from YouTube appears on the same page and is of sufficient value to be the basis for such sales.
   5. Prohibited commercial uses do not include:
          * uploading an original video to YouTube, or maintaining an original channel on YouTube, to promote your business or artistic enterprise;
          * showing YouTube videos through the Embeddable Player on an ad-enabled blog or website, subject to the advertising restrictions set forth above in Section 4.D; or
          * any use that YouTube expressly authorizes in writing.

   8. You agree not to use or launch any automated system, including without limitation, "robots," "spiders," or "offline readers," that accesses the Service in a manner that sends more request messages to the YouTube servers in a given period of time than a human can reasonably produce in the same period by using a conventional on-line web browser. Notwithstanding the foregoing, YouTube grants the operators of public search engines permission to use spiders to copy materials from the site for the sole purpose of and solely to the extent necessary for creating publicly available searchable indices of the materials, but not caches or archives of such materials.

          * A physical or electronic signature of a person authorized to act on behalf of the owner of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed;
          * Identification of the copyrighted work claimed to have been infringed, or, if multiple copyrighted works at a single online site are covered by a single notification, a representative list of such works at that site;
          * Identification of the material that is claimed to be infringing or to be the subject of infringing activity and that is to be removed or access to which is to be disabled and information reasonably sufficient to permit the service provider to locate the material;
          * Information reasonably sufficient to permit the service provider to contact you, such as an address, telephone number, and, if available, an electronic mail;
          * A statement that you have a good faith belief that use of the material in the manner complained of is not authorized by the copyright owner, its agent, or the law; and
          * A statement that the information in the notification is accurate, and under penalty of perjury, that you are authorized to act on behalf of the owner of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed.

For clarity, only DMCA notices should go to the Copyright Agent; any other feedback, comments, requests for technical support, and other communications should be directed to YouTube customer service through http://www.google.com/support/youtube. You acknowledge that if you fail to comply with all of the requirements of this Section 5(D), your DMCA notice may not be valid.
</span>

<span class="counter-notice">

   2. Counter-Notice. If you believe that your Content that was removed (or to which access was disabled) is not infringing, or that you have the 
authorization from the copyright owner, the copyright owner's agent, or pursuant to the law, to post and use the material in your Content, you may 
send a counter-notice containing the following information to the Copyright Agent:

          * Your physical or electronic signature;
          * Identification of the Content that has been removed or to which access has been disabled and the location at which the Content appeared before it was removed or disabled;
          * A statement that you have a good faith belief that the Content was removed or disabled as a result of mistake or a misidentification of the Content; and
          * Your name, address, telephone number, and e-mail address, a statement that you consent to the jurisdiction of the federal court in San Francisco, California, and a statement that you will accept service of process from the person who provided notification of the alleged infringement.

            If a counter-notice is received by the Copyright Agent, YouTube may send a copy of the counter-notice to the original complaining party 
informing that person that it may replace the removed Content or cease disabling it in 10 business days. Unless the copyright owner files an action 
seeking a court order against the Content provider, member or user, the removed Content may be replaced, or access to it restored, in 10 to 14 
business days or more after receipt of the counter-notice, at YouTube's sole discretion.

<span class="choiceOfLawCourt">
<span class="subjectToChange">

14. General

You agree that: (i) the Service shall be deemed solely based in California; and (ii) the Service shall be deemed a passive website that does not give 
rise to personal jurisdiction over YouTube, either specific or general, in jurisdictions other than California. These Terms of Service shall be 
governed by the internal substantive laws of the State of California, without respect to its conflict of laws principles. Any claim or dispute 
between you and YouTube that arises in whole or in part from the Service shall be decided exclusively by a court of competent jurisdiction located in 
Santa Clara County, California. These Terms of Service, together with the Privacy Notice at http://www.youtube.com/t/privacy and any other legal 
notices published by YouTube on the Service, shall constitute the entire agreement between you and YouTube concerning the Service. If any provision 
of these Terms of Service is deemed invalid by a court of competent jurisdiction, the invalidity of such provision shall not affect the validity of 
the remaining provisions of these Terms of Service, which shall remain in full force and effect. No waiver of any term of this these Terms of Service 
shall be deemed a further or continuing waiver of such term or any other term, and YouTube's failure to assert any right or provision under these 
Terms of Service shall not constitute a waiver of such right or provision. YouTube reserves the right to amend these Terms of Service at any time and 
without notice, and it is your responsibility to review these Terms of Service for any changes. Your use of the Service following any amendment of 
these Terms of Service will signify your assent to and acceptance of its revised terms. YOU AND YOUTUBE AGREE THAT ANY CAUSE OF ACTION ARISING OUT OF 
OR RELATED TO THE SERVICES MUST COMMENCE WITHIN ONE (1) YEAR AFTER THE CAUSE OF ACTION ACCRUES. OTHERWISE, SUCH CAUSE OF ACTION IS PERMANENTLY 
BARRED.
