</p><h2>Statement of Rights and Responsibilities</h2><p>
	<span class="">
		This Statement of Rights and Responsibilities (Statement) derives from the Facebook Principles, and governs our relationship with users and others who interact with Facebook. By using or accessing Facebook, you agree to this Statement.
	</span>
</p><h2>Privacy</h2><p>
	<span class="">
		This Statement of Rights and Responsibilities (Statement) derives from the Facebook Principles, and governs our relationship with users and others who interact with Facebook. 
		By using or accessing Facebook, you agree to this Statement.
		Your privacy is very important to us.
		We designed our Privacy Policy to make important disclosures about how you can use Facebook to share with others and how we collect and can use your content and information.
		We encourage you to read the Privacy Policy, and to use it to help make informed decisions.
 	</span>
</p><h2>Sharing Your Content and Information</h2><p>
	<span class="">
		You own all of the content and information you post on Facebook, and you can control how it is shared through your privacy and application settings.
		In addition:
		For content that is covered by intellectual property rights, like photos and videos (IP content), you specifically give us the following permission, subject to your privacy and application settings: you grant us a non-exclusive, transferable, sub-licensable, royalty-free, worldwide license to use any IP content that you post on or in connection with Facebook (IP License).
		This IP License ends when you delete your IP content or your account unless your content has been shared with others, and they have not deleted it.
		When you delete IP content, it is deleted in a manner similar to emptying the recycle bin on a computer.
		However, you understand that removed content may persist in backup copies for a reasonable period of time (but will not be available to others).
		When you use an application, your content and information is shared with the application.
		We require applications to respect your privacy, and your agreement with that application will control how the application can use, store, and transfer that content and information.
		(To learn more about Platform, read our Privacy Policy and Platform Page.)
		When you publish content or information using the everyone setting, it means that you are allowing everyone, including people off of Facebook, to access and use that information, and to associate it with you (i.e., your name and profile picture).
		We always appreciate your feedback or other suggestions about Facebook, but you understand that we may use them without any obligation to compensate you for them (just as you have no obligation to offer them).
 	</span>
</p><h2>Safety</h2><p>
	<span class="">
		We do our best to keep Facebook safe, but we cannot guarantee it.
		We need your help to do that, which includes the following commitments:

		You will not upload viruses or other malicious code.
		You will not solicit login information or access an account belonging to someone else.

		You will not post content that: is hateful, threatening, or pornographic; incites violence; or contains nudity or graphic or gratuitous violence.
		You will not develop or operate a third-party application containing alcohol-related or other mature content (including advertisements) without appropriate age-based restrictions.
