    "tldr": "You can not delete your account. You can only beg AirBnB to do it for you:  \"If you want to permanently close and delete your account, contact us.\" In that case AirBnB will insist that you to provide further personal information to \"We will verify your identity for security purposes before accepting the deletion request.\" which is up to them to accept or insist more proof for their records. So effectively, you can not delete your account from this service. This happened to me and the account still exists as I refused to keep sending them more and more documents just close the account while the original reason for closing the account was them violating my privacy."
