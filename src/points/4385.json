Thus, if you are caught using the service and are, let's say, younger than 13 (13 is the age limit), you are not following the terms even if you don't have an account. Users also include \"contributors of Content to the Service,\" (\"Content\" = \"the text, software, scripts, graphics, photos, sounds, music, videos, audiovisual combinations, interactive features and other Content you may view on, access through, or contribute to the Service.\") but this is obvious.",
