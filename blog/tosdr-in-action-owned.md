# “What is yours stays yours”: Oh, really?

[This post is part of a series in collaboration with the BBC Radio 4 “Law in Action,” where we try to debunked some of the myths related to terms of service and privacy policies.

This week, we're focusing on another big matter when it comes to
terms of service. This one takes many forms and raises
questions (“can they sell my content?”), that some Terms try to
deal with by writing things like: “What is yours stays yours” or
“You retain your rights to your photos”, etc.

However, most of these statements are meaningless. Because
copyright law doesn't work that way; there are many things you can
do with a copyright which are not “selling” in a legal sense.

## A (very) basic introduction to copyright and author's rights

The basic principle is that once a person has created or invested
in a work, usually with a minimum of creativity, this person is
automatically considered the “author” or the copyright holder of
that work. (There are differences around the world, but we can say
it's a basic principle under the Berne convention that treats 
copyright and author's rights).

The aim of such laws has various justifications: allowing
to reward creators for their work and incentivise their production;
organising exclusive rights to enable return-on-investments;
enhancing creativity to bring benefits to society at large; etc. 

If nowadays, copyright has been discussed at great lengths in the
media and in politics as a burning issue as for non-authorised
distribution of music and films on the Internet, another
significant side of copyright has been mainly overlooked.

## How services exploit your copyright

Today, incredibly vast amounts of copyrighted works are published
by users on the Web (in the so-called Web 2.0 era of “User
Generated Content”), through publication services such as Twitter,
Facebook, YouTube, Instagram, etc.  However, very
little has been said about what happens to users' copyrights. The
sad truth is, a lot of services are claiming over-broad rights on
users' content; content which creation they had no involvement
with whatsoever. 

 * True, with these services “you retain your rights” to your
   content. They do not ask for a transfer of copyright ownership,
   but they mainly ask you to grant them  broad, sometimes
   almost-unlimited licenses to your content.
 * True, these services do not “sell” your content. What they do is
  they *transfer* the license you grant them, or the grant
  *sublicenses* themselves to third-parties.
 * True, users have “agreed” to that. But we know that the current
   agreement to terms of service is [meaningless][ep1] and that
   moreover for many services (Twitter, Facebook, Instagram,
   Twitpic, etc.) the current copyright license was made in
   changes to the terms.

[Twitter](http://tosdr.org/#twitter) can change the terms at any
time when they see fit. They give notification, in their sole
discretion, via an @Twitter update or via email. In September 2009,
Twitter considerably changed the terms for the copyright license
and only gave a very short notice, only a few hours before the
changes applied. Moreover, if you actually try to go read that
email, and then the blog post it links to, you will notice that
Twitter omits to mention the biggest changes to their copyright
license. [See our discussion:
[on the mailing-list](https://groups.google.com/d/msg/tosdr/-B4iO-9xHvg/0yoWGoEISrEJ)]

[Twitpic](http://tosdr.org/#twitpic)  has been able to exploit the
rights users have granted them, most probably without knowing. For
instance, when Twitpic realised they could make money off their
users' pictures, they [changed the copyright
license](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-13372982) to make a
deal with media agency WENN.

When [Instagram](http://tosdr.org/#instagram) was bought by Facebook, they only had a limited
copyright license that was neither transferable, nor
sublicensable. At this stage, although Facebook had bought the
company Instagram for $1 billion, Facebook could not really
benefit from the rights over users' photos. Guess what, when
Instagram changed their terms in January this year, they aligned
their copyright license to Facebook's (among [other issues](http://www.slate.com/blogs/future_tense/2012/12/19/instagram_privacy_everyone_s_ignoring_the_real_problems_with_its_terms_of.html)).

Before January 19, 2013:

> Proprietary Rights in Content on Instagram
> 
> 1. Instagram does NOT claim ANY ownership rights in the text, files, images, photos, video, sounds, musical works, works of authorship, applications, or any other materials (collectively, "Content") that you post on or through the Instagram Services. By displaying or publishing ("posting") any Content on or through the Instagram Services, you hereby grant to Instagram a non-exclusive, fully paid and royalty-free, worldwide, limited license to use, modify, delete from, add to, publicly perform, publicly display, reproduce and translate such Content, including without limitation distributing part or all of the Site in any media formats through any media channels, except Content not shared publicly ("private") will not be distributed outside the Instagram Services.

After January 19, 2013:

> Rights
> 
> 1. Instagram does not claim ownership of any Content that you post on or through the Service. Instead, *you hereby grant to Instagram a non-exclusive, fully paid and royalty-free, transferable, sub-licensable, worldwide license to use the Content that you post on or through the Service,* subject to the Service's Privacy Policy, available here http://instagram.com/legal/privacy/, including but not limited to sections 3 ("Sharing of Your Information"), 4 ("How We Store Your Information"), and 5 ("Your Choices About Your Information"). You can choose who can view your Content and activities, including your photos, as described in the Privacy Policy.

Facebook's current terms:

> 2. Sharing Your Content and Information
> 
>    You own all of the content and information you post on Facebook, and you can control how it is shared through your privacy and application settings. In addition:
> 
>    1. For content that is covered by intellectual property rights, like photos and videos (IP content), you specifically give us the following permission, subject to your privacy and application settings: *you grant us a non-exclusive, transferable, sub-licensable, royalty-free, worldwide license to use any IP content that you post on or in connection with Facebook* (IP License). This IP License ends when you delete your IP content or your account unless your content has been shared with others, and they have not deleted it.

(Do not hesitate to have a look back at Facebook's [previous copyright
licenses](http://consumerist.com/2009/02/15/facebooks-new-terms-of-service-we-can-do-anything-we-want-with-your-content-forever/))

## But, this is necessary for them, right?

I have seen some arguments, stating that these copyright licenses
are “boilerplate” (implying they're everywhere) and that they're
really necessary for them to provide you with the service.

But this is far from true. First, these copyright terms are far
from boilerplate. Indeed, even between similar services, there are
huge differences. As you can see here, there is a wide vaeriety of
copyright licenses that we have
[mapped](http://tosdr.org/topics.html#copyright-scope).

For instance, the copyright license you grant to
[YouTube](http://tosdr.org/#youtube) bears no explicit limitation,
whereas [Vimeo's](http://tosdr.org/#vimeo) copyright
license is explicitly limited to 4 purposes. Moreover, the
copyright license you grant to Vimeo is neither transferable nor
sublicensable, as opposed to YouTube.

To take another example, you can compare the copyright license
that [Twitter][] requires with the license for
[Identi.ca](http://tosdr.org/#identi-ca) or
[SeenThis](http://tosdr.org/#seenthis). In case this isn't
significant enough, you can also compare Twitter's current
copyright license, with the copyright license they had [before
2009](https://twitter.com/tos/previous).

If it were really necessary for these services to get such broad
copyright licenses, I still see no clear reason why they would ask
for the possibility to *transfer* or to *sublicense* them. On the
other hand, if it is a matter of necessity, then services could
just state it clearly in the copyright licenses themselves. For
instance, [SoundCloud](http://tosdr.org/#soundcloud) asks for
copyright license like this: 

> **To the extent it is necessary** in order for SoundCloud to provide
> you with any of the aforementioned hosting services,
> to undertake any of the tasks set forth in these
> Terms of Use and/or to enable your use of the
> Platform, you hereby grant such licences to
> SoundCloud on a **limited**, worldwide, non-exclusive,
> royalty-free and fully paid basis. [Source](https://groups.google.com/d/topic/tosdr/_gI8wQ3PZ2M/discussion)
