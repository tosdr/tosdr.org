				  Each data point will be assigned a weight in the rating of the website in question as soon as there is a rough consensus in the mailing list thread. So the classification of each website simply depends on how many positive and negative data points we have posted about it on the mailing list.
        </p>
				<p>
					Each services gets a series of badges, either <span class="badge badge-success"><i class="icon-thumbs-up icon-white">+</i> Good</span>, <span class="badge badge-warning"><i class="icon-thumbs-down icon-white">-</i> Mediocre</span>, <span class="badge badge-important"><i class="icon-remove icon-white">×</i> Alert</span>, or <span class="badge"><i class="icon-arrow-right icon-white">→</i> Informative</span>; depending on how fair they are compared to other services. One way to compare is to <a href="topics.html">analyse by topics</a>. When we collect all the points, each service gets assigned a class.
				</p>
				<p>
					<span class="label A" style="vertical-align:middle">Class A</span> are the best terms of services: they treat you fairly, respect your rights and will not abuse your data.
				</p>
				<p><span class="label B">Class B</span>&nbsp; The terms of services are fair towards the user but they  could be improved.</p>
				<p><span class="label C">Class C</span>&nbsp; The terms of service are okay but some issues need your consideration.</p>
				<p><span class="label D">Class D</span>&nbsp; The terms of service are very uneven or there are some important issues that need your attention.</p>
				<p><span class="label E">Class E</span>&nbsp; The terms of service raise very serious concerns.</p>
				<p><span class="label false">No Class Yet</span>&nbsp; We haven't sufficiently reviewed the terms yet. Please <a href="get-involved.html">Get involved!</a>

				<div class="page-header"><h2>About <small>this Unhosted project</small></h2></div>
				<p>
					The rough idea behind ToS;DR emerged during the <a href="http://events.ccc.de/camp/2011/wiki/ToS;DR">2011 Chaos Communication Camp</a> near Berlin, with people from <a href="http://unhosted.org">Unhosted</a> a movement to create web apps that give users control over their valuable user data and privacy. Since June 2012, <a href="http://hugoroy.eu/index.en.html">Hugo Roy</a> (<a href="http://twitter.com/hugoroyd">@hugoroyd</a>) has taken the lead for the project, and started the legal analysis. Ultimately, all the work is transparent and the discussions happen in public.  Our work is funded by non-profits organisations and individual <a href="https://flattr.com/thing/821090/ToSDR">donations</a> and gets released as <a href="http://fsfe.org/about/basics/freesoftware.html">free software</a> and open data.</a>
				</p>
				<p><strong>What does “ToS;DR” mean?</strong> the name is inspired by internet acronym TL;DR which stands for "Too Long; Didn't Read" and is often used on blogs and emails when a block of text is just really long and that people are too lazy to read the whole stuff. It was intended more as a code name than as a real name. But it seems that people like it (do you?)</p>
