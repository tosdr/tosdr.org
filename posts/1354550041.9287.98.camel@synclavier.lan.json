  "text": "Hello everyone,\n\nIn order to meet the standards of transparency which are appropriate for\nthis project, here's my monthly report for my participation to ToS;DR.\n\n      * November 3rd: finances (we're investigating what's the best\n        formal or informal way to deal with the projects' finance since\n        the crowdfunding. We're basically looking in whether we should\n        set up a legal person with a French reg. association (loi 1901)\n        or if just non reg. association might work (also loi 1901).\n        We're also looking at what's the best way to deal with\n        contributors who get a remuneration for the work they do on the\n        project (what kind of contract, what kind of tax status, etc.)\n        and where would the money come from (we might get some help from\n        FDNN: a French fund managing financial aspects for associations\n        dealing with digital freedoms).\n      * 10th & 11th: talk at FSCONS, in Goteborg\n      * I've also started working on a new kind of way for people to\n        contribute to the project. See\n        https://github.com/didnotread/didnotread.org/issues?state=open\n        #46 47 48 and 49 and\n        https://github.com/didnotread/didnotread.org/tree/gh-pages/point\n      * 13th: I'm launching a sister-project for France with law\n        students at Sciences Po. So I have to work with the existing\n        associations and convince the university administration to\n        support the project, and also find motivated students to work on\n        it.\n      * 14th: working on the version 2 of the website, and writing a\n        report (see http://tos-dr.info/blog/ )\n      * 15th: working with Ian to explain how to make the data points\n        from the mailing list (researching the terms', analysing them,\n        comparing with topics from existing points, writing style for\n        the data, formatting etc)\n      * 16th: worked on several data points (don't remember which, but\n        this can be checkd on the changelog at\n        https://github.com/didnotread/didnotread.org/ )\n      * 17th: gave a talk at Paris' Ubuntu Party\n      * 19th: working on the website and the blog\n      * 20th: working on a new interface proposal (see\n        https://github.com/didnotread/didnotread.org/tree/gh-pages/point\n        )\n\nTotal Time logged: 26,7 hours\nAdvocacy and communication: ~6 hours\nTools Development: ~3 hours\n  + Website version 2: ~5 hours\nGovernance (report, blog, transparency): ~6 hours\nData points: ~4 hours\n\nFor news from Ian: http://tos-dr.info/blog/first-news-from-ian.html\nNews from Jimm are coming soon ;)\n\nAbout the perks from Indiegogo, Michiel and Jan will give you an update\nsoon.\n\nBest,\nHugo\n-- \nHugo Roy \n  French Coordinator, FSFE       chat: hugo@jabber.fsfe.org\n  www.fsfe.org/about/roy         mobile: +336 08 74 13 41\n                                 mobile DE: +49 151 143 56 563\n\n-- \nwww.tos-dr.info // www.twitter.com/tosdr // www.github.com/didnotread\n--- \nYou received this message because you are subscribed to the Google Groups \"Terms of Service; Didn't Read\" group.\nTo post to this group, send email to tosdr@googlegroups.com.\nTo unsubscribe from this group, send email to tosdr+unsubscribe@googlegroups.com.\nVisit this group at http://groups.google.com/group/tosdr?hl=en.\nFor more options, visit https://groups.google.com/groups/opt_out.\n\n\n",
