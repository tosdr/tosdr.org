Arbitration is more informal than a lawsuit in court. \nArbitration uses a neutral arbitrator instead of a judge or jury, allows \nfor more limited discovery than in court, and is subject to very limited \nreview by courts. Arbitrators can award the same damages and relief that a \ncourt can award. You agree that, by agreeing to these Terms of Use, the \nU.S. Federal Arbitration Act governs the interpretation and enforcement of \nthis provision, and that you and Netflix are each waiving the right to a \ntrial by jury or to participate in a class action. This arbitration \nprovision shall survive termination of this Agreement and the termination \nof your Netflix membership. * \n\n\n *YOU AND NETFLIX AGREE THAT EACH MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY \nIN YOUR OR ITS INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY, AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER \nIN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING. * \n\n-- \nwww.tos-dr.info // www.twitter.com/tosdr // www.github.com/Unhosted/ToS-DR\n--- \nYou received this message because you are subscribed to the Google Groups \"Terms of Service; Didn't Read\" group.\nTo post to this group, send email to tosdr@googlegroups.com.\nTo unsubscribe from this group, send email to tosdr+unsubscribe@googlegroups.com.\nVisit this group at http://groups.google.com/group/tosdr?hl=en.\nFor more options, visit https://groups.google.com/groups/opt_out.\n\n\n",
