By serving these advertisements directly to you, these companies can set their own cookies on your computer and trigger their own Web beacons and other tracking technologies to measure the effectiveness of their advertisements, and to collect and track information such as demographic information, inferred interests, aggregated information, and activity to assist them in personalizing the advertising content delivered to you. Twitch does not provide your personally identifiable information to these third-party ad servers or ad networks without your consent. However, please note that if an advertiser asks Twitch to show an advertisement to a certain audience (for example, males age 15 to 18) or audience segment (for example, males age 15 to 18 who have participated in certain promotions) and you respond to that advertisement, the advertiser or ad-server may conclude that you fit the description of the audience that they were trying to reach. \n\nAdvertisments can be served through third parties. These third parties do not receive data from twitch directly, only the request to serve an advert. These third parties may track you. The request to serve may be targeted to a specific age-group potentially allowing the third party to categorize you.\n\n\n[Good] The description of notice of twitch is very good and specific.\n\n-- \ntosdr.org | twitter.com/tosdr | github.com/tosdr\n--- \nYou received this message because you are subscribed to the Google Groups \"Terms of Service; Didn't Read\" group.\nTo unsubscribe from this group and stop receiving emails from it, send an email to tosdr+unsubscribe@googlegroups.com.\nTo post to this group, send email to tosdr@googlegroups.com.\nVisit this group at http://groups.google.com/group/tosdr.\nFor more options, visit https://groups.google.com/groups/opt_out.\n",
