  "text": "\nThe privacy policy states under \"Information we share\"\n\n    We do not share personal information with companies,\n    organizations and individuals outside of Google unless one of\n    the following circumstances apply:\n\n        With your consent\n\n            We will share personal information with companies,\n            organizations or individuals outside of Google when we\n            have your consent to do so. We require opt-in consent\n            for the sharing of any sensitive personal information.\n\n        […]\n\n    We may share aggregated, non-personally identifiable\n    information publicly and with our partners – like publishers,\n    advertisers or connected sites. For example, we may share\n    information publicly to show trends about the general use of\n    our services. \n\nThis second bit should not be underestimated, as the terms is only\ndefined as “This is information that is recorded about users so\nthat it no longer reflects or references an individually\nidentifiable user.” in http://www.google.com/intl/en/policies/privacy/key-terms/#toc-terms-info\n\nMy real concern though is with the above. There is a contradiction\nbetween the first statement and the first item on the list. Google\nsays they don't share personal info unless they get your consent,\nbut they make a distinction between:\n\n - Personal information\n\n    defined as \"This is information which you provide to us which\n    personally identifies you, such as your name, email address or\n    billing information, or other data which can be reasonably\n    linked to such information by Google.\"\n\n - Sensitive personal information\n\n    This is a particular category of personal information relating\n    to confidential medical facts, racial or ethnic origins,\n    political or religious beliefs or sexuality. \n\nAnd they say that they require “opt-in consent” for the sharing of\nthe latter, which seems to imply that for sharing usual personal\ninformation with others, Google does not require “opt-in consent”.\n\nI am curious to what consent that's not \"opt-in consent\" looks\nlike. In the context of a privacy policy like this one, since you\nalready consent to use Google's services and to upload some data\nand to allow them to collect some data, it seems that by default\nyou consent to the sharing of non-sensitive personal information.\n\nWhat do others think?\n\nI propose to reduce our point to information that can be shared\nwithout requiring subsequent \"opt-in\" consent and so to sum it up\nlike this:\n\n    Google can share personal information and aggregated\n    non-personal information with other parties\n\nGoogle will share your personal information with other parties.\nFor sensitive information (medical, racial, ethnic, political,\nreligious or sexuality) Google requires “opt-in”. Google can also\nshare or publish aggregated data that does not identify a\nperson.\n\ntopic: https://tosdr.org/topics.html#third\npoint: mediocre\nscore: 50\n\n\n-- \nHugo Roy, Project Lead\nTerms of Service; Didn't Read | www.tosdr.org\n\n-- \ntosdr.org | twitter.com/tosdr | github.com/tosdr\n--- \nYou received this message because you are subscribed to the Google Groups \"Terms of Service; Didn't Read\" group.\nTo unsubscribe from this group and stop receiving emails from it, send an email to tosdr+unsubscribe@googlegroups.com.\nTo post to this group, send email to tosdr@googlegroups.com.\nVisit this group at http://groups.google.com/group/tosdr?hl=en.\nFor more options, visit https://groups.google.com/groups/opt_out.\n\n\n",
