{"text":"\n-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----\nHash: SHA1\n\nhttps://bitpay.com/privacy-policy\n\nIn general was a easily reading Privacy Policy.\n\n*Stanza 1 - How changes in Privacy Policy are treated *\n\n_Line 3-4_: /\"The revised version will be effective at the time we post\nit. In addition, if the revised version includes a substantial change,\nwe will provide you with 30 days prior notice by posting notice of the\nchange on the \"Privacy Policy\" page of our website.\"/\n\nWell, the bad is, little but substantial changes could be made without\nprevious advice, and the good, what they classify as important, will\nstay in the page.\n\n*Stanza 2 - **About how they collect information*\n \n_Line 1-2_: \"/standard web log information, such as your browser type\nand the pages you accessed on our website.\"/\n\nThey say \"/standard web log information\", but it could be all the info'\nour browsers provide them, and this is without creating an account.\n\n_Line 3-5:_ //\"you open an account or use the BitPay Services, we may\ncollect the following types of information://\n//- Contact information: your name, address, phone, email, Skype ID\n//*and other similar information.*//\n//- Financial information: the full bank account numbers that you link\nto your BitPay account or give us when you use the BitPay Services.\"//\n\nNo comments here.\n\n*Stanza 3\n\n*/_Line 2:_/*\"*//We may also obtain information about you from third\nparties such as credit bureaus and identity verification services.\"/\n\nIn other words, they can research about us.\n\n*Stanza 4*\n\n/\"When you are using the BitPay Services, we collect information about\nyour transactions and your other activities on our website or using the\nBitPay Services and we may collect information about your computer or\nother access device for fraud prevention purposes. \"/\n\nThey are collecting too much information.\n\n*Stanza 7 - How they use cookies*\n\n/\"We also use longer-lasting cookies for other purposes such as to\ndisplay your e-mail address on our sign-in form, so that you don't need\nto retype the e-mail address each time you log in to your account. //\"/\n\nWell they use cookies like other tracker sites...\n\n*Stanza 8 **\n*\n_Line 1-2:_ /\"We encode our cookies so that only we can interpret the\ninformation stored in them. You are free to decline our cookies if your\nbrowser permits, but doing so may interfere with your use of our\nwebsite.//\"/\n\nWell, cookies coding is a good thing, and they \"let\" us deny the store\nof cookies.\n\n_Line 2:_  /\"We may also collect information about your computer or\nother access device to mitigate risk and for fraud prevention purposes. //\"/\n\nAs I said before, this privacy policy let them collect everything.\n\n*Stanza 9*\n\n/\"You may encounter cookies from third parties when using the BitPay\nServices on websites that we do not control (for example, if you view a\nweb page created by a third party or use an application developed by a\nthird party, there may be a cookie placed by that web page or\napplication.) \"/\n\nThat's a very bad thing.\n\n*Stanza 11* *- **How they protect and store personal information*\n\n/\"We store and process your personal information on our computers in the\nUS and elsewhere in the world where BitPay facilities are located, and\nwe protect it by maintaining physical, electronic and procedural\nsafeguards in compliance with applicable US federal and state\nregulations. *We use computer safeguards such as firewalls and data\nencryption, we enforce physical access controls to our buildings and\nfiles, and we authorize access to personal information only for those\nemployees who require it to fulfill their job responsibilities.*\"/\n\nWell, the part that is in bold is some good but before that, they could\nstore that information in everywhere, and they use those regulations\nfrom U.S, this is valid for the NSA breakable ones?\n\n*Stanza 13 - How they use the personal information they collect*\n\n/\"- provide the BitPay Services and customer support you request; -\nprocess transactions and send notices about your transactions; - resolve\ndisputes, collect fees, and troubleshoot problems; - prevent potentially\nprohibited or illegal activities, and enforce our User Agreement; -\ncustomize, measure, and improve the BitPay Services and the content and\nlayout of our website and applications; - deliver targeted marketing,\nservice update notices, and promotional offers based on your\ncommunication preferences; - compare information for accuracy and verify\nit with third parties. \"/\n\nWell, this is quite good, the information they collect (that doesn't\ninclude the third-party cookies) in my see isn't shared with anyone\nwithout a law enforcement.\nSomeone say contrary?\n\n*Stanza 14 - Marketing*\n\n_Line 1:_ \"We do not sell or rent your personal information to third\nparties for their marketing purposes without your explicit consent\"\n\nVery good...\n_\n__Line 2-4:_ \"/If you do not wish to receive marketing communications\nfrom us or participate in our ad-customization programs, simply indicate\nyour preference by logging into your account and going to the Profile\nsubtab under the My Account tab and adjusting your preferences under\nAccount Information, or by following the directions provided with the\ncommunication or advertisement.\"\n\n/So... They let us choice something. Good.\n*\n**Stanza 14-18**- **How we share personal information with other BitPay\nusers **\n*\n\nTo process your payments, we may share some of your personal information\nwith the person or company that you are paying or that is paying you.\nYour contact information, date of sign-up, the number of payments you\nhave received from verified BitPay users, and whether you have verified\ncontrol of a bank account are provided to other BitPay users who you\ntransact with through BitPay. *In addition, this and other information\nmay also be shared with third parties when you use these third parties\nto access the BitPay Services. Unless you have agreed to it, these third\nparties are not allowed to use this information for any purpose other\nthan to enable the BitPay Services. *\n\nIf you are buying goods or services and pay through BitPay, we may also\nprovide the seller with your confirmed credit card billing address to\nhelp complete your transaction with the seller. *The seller is not\nallowed to use this information to market their services to you unless\nyou have agreed to it.* If an attempt to pay your seller fails, or is\nlater invalidated, we may also provide your seller with details of the\nunsuccessful payment. To facilitate dispute resolutions, we may provide\na buyer with the sellers address so that goods can be returned to the\nseller.\n\nWe work with third parties, including merchants, to enable them to\naccept or facilitate payments from or to you using BitPay. In doing so,\na third party may share information about you with us, such as your\nemail address or mobile phone number to inform you that a payment is\nsent to you or when you attempt to pay that merchant or through that\nthird party. We use this information to confirm to that you are a BitPay\ncustomer and that BitPay as a form of payment can be enabled, or where a\npayment is sent to you to send you notification that you have received a\npayment. Also, if you request that we validate your status as a BitPay\ncustomer with a third party, we will do so. Please note that merchants\nyou buy from and contract with have their own privacy policies, and\nBitPay may not be held responsible for their operations, including, but\nnot limited to, their information practices.\n\nThe first bold, well, the synchronizing made with BitPay could let us\nsome privacy issues, but not at all, see, they don't have access to the\nsame information as BitPay.\nThe information that in my vision, is some essential to negotiate with\nBitPay is provided to another users, to confirm identity.\nThe second bold, the seller is limited with our information, good.\n\n\n- -- \nSynamics\n    <A href=\"mailto:synamics@riseup.net\">synamics@riseup.net</A>.\n    <A href=\" \">GPG: 8BCC264B (1570 A5FC 48D1 99C6 1C45  E847 567E 231A\n8BCC 264B)</A>\n-----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE-----\nVersion: GnuPG v2.0.21 (GNU/Linux)\n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\newaUHWpieOM/nNbGjl22\n=b8bY\n-----END PGP SIGNATURE-----\n\n\n","headers":{"return-path":"<tosdr+bncBAABBEE3VWIQKGQEIKCTUEY@googlegroups.com>","delivered-to":"anything@michielbdejong.com","received":["from spool.mail.gandi.net (mspool1-d.mgt.gandi.net [10.0.21.131]) by nmboxes31-d.mgt.gandi.net (Postfix) with ESMTP id AFF8B161735 for <anything@michielbdejong.com>; Sat,  7 Sep 2013 18:00:23 +0200 (CEST)","from mfilter16-d.gandi.net (mfilter16-d.gandi.net [217.70.178.144]) by spool.mail.gandi.net (Postfix) with ESMTP id AB8252260AB for <anything@michielbdejong.com>; Sat,  7 Sep 2013 18:00:23 +0200 (CEST)","from spool.mail.gandi.net ([10.0.21.131]) by mfilter16-d.gandi.net (mfilter16-d.gandi.net [10.0.15.180]) (amavisd-new, port 10024) with ESMTP id rzSV13StMYBO for <anything@michielbdejong.com>; Sat,  7 Sep 2013 18:00:21 +0200 (CEST)","from mail-pa0-x23d.google.com (mail-pa0-x23d.google.com [IPv6:2607:f8b0:400e:c03::23d]) by spool.mail.gandi.net (Postfix) with ESMTPS id 7547E22608B for <michiel@michielbdejong.com>; Sat,  7 Sep 2013 18:00:18 +0200 (CEST)","by mail-pa0-f61.google.com with SMTP id kp13sf1057194pab.16 for <michiel@michielbdejong.com>; Sat, 07 Sep 2013 09:00:16 -0700 (PDT)","by 10.50.136.198 with SMTP id qc6ls1092036igb.42.canary; Sat, 07 Sep 2013 09:00:16 -0700 (PDT)","from mx1.riseup.net (mx1.riseup.net.
