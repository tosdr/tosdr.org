{"text":"Cool site and service!  Would love to contribute.  Here's a quickie on Meetup.com, a site for facilitating real-world gatherings of people with common interests (\"using the Internet to get off the Internet\").\n\nTOPIC: Notice of Changing Terms\n\nThe top of Meetup's TOS isn't great, but it's a fairly typical we-may-change-at-any-time-check-our-website statement.  There's no notification; it is the user's responsibility to look at the most recent revision \"frequently.\" \n\nWhat I was surprised by is down below in Fees & Payments.  They reserve the right to start charging for use of the website at any time.  They also reserve the right to change features/services and their fees at any time.  And, once they notify you (not specified how), you must pay and Meetup doesn't care about your expenses, overdrawn accounts, etc.  They don't specify what would happen to your account info if you choose not to pay.  They don't specify how they will notify you - just one email that might end up in a spam or Gmail Promotions folder?  The only saving grace here is that free users of Meetup don't provide payment info (at least, not as of last year, when I signed up for my account).  So I guess this mean-sounding policy doesn't have teeth vis-a-vis free users.  Which means it doesn't play out practically in addition to sounding unfriendly. \n\n\nHere's the text (at http://www.meetup.com/terms/)\n\n3. Fees and Payments\n3.1 General. Access to our websites and use of selected features of our Platform is free. We may charge fees for various premium features and services that we offer, and we will notify you of those charges at the time that we offer you the premium features or services for a fee. We may, in our sole discretion, and by notifying you on our website, change this policy and begin charging for access to our website and other features and services, and we may, in our sole discretion, add, remove or change the features and services we offer or the fees (including the amount or the type of fees) we charge at any time. If we introduce a new service or charge a new fee, we will establish and notify you of the fees for that service at the launch of the service or start of charging a new fee. If we notify you of new fees or change the fees for an existing service, you agree to pay all fees and charges specified and all applicable taxes for your continued use of the applicable service. We are not responsible for any charges or expenses you incur resulting from being billed by us in accordance with these Terms of Service (e.g., overdrawn accounts, exceeding account limits, etc.). \n\n\n-- \ntosdr.org | twitter.com/tosdr | github.com/tosdr\n--- \nYou received this message because you are subscribed to the Google Groups \"Terms of Service; Didn't Read\" group.\nTo unsubscribe from this group and stop receiving emails from it, send an email to tosdr+unsubscribe@googlegroups.com.\nTo post to this group, send email to tosdr@googlegroups.com.\nVisit this group at http://groups.google.com/group/tosdr.\nFor more options, visit https://groups.google.com/groups/opt_out.\n","headers":{"return-path":"<tosdr+bncBCTZ5L7WSEIBBQNXY6JQKGQEM4EIGBY@googlegroups.com>","delivered-to":"anything@michielbdejong.com","received":["from spool.mail.gandi.net (mspool1-d.mgt.gandi.net [10.0.21.131]) by nmboxes77-d.mgt.gandi.net (Postfix) with ESMTP id 940FA40E1F for <anything@michielbdejong.com>; Thu, 31 Oct 2013 05:25:44 +0100 (CET)","from mfilter28-d.gandi.net (mfilter28-d.gandi.net [217.70.178.159]) by spool.mail.gandi.net (Postfix) with ESMTP id 91615226083 for <anything@michielbdejong.com>; Thu, 31 Oct 2013 05:25:44 +0100 (CET)","from spool.mail.gandi.net ([10.0.21.131]) by mfilter28-d.gandi.net (mfilter28-d.gandi.net [10.0.15.180]) (amavisd-new, port 10024) with ESMTP id x+CleOeoxYni for <anything@michielbdejong.com>; Thu, 31 Oct 2013 05:25:43 +0100 (CET)","from mail-oa0-x23d.google.com (mail-oa0-x23d.google.com [IPv6:2607:f8b0:4003:c02::23d]) by spool.mail.gandi.net (Postfix) with ESMTPS id AB24A2260A3 for <anything@michielbdejong.com>; Thu, 31 Oct 2013 05:25:39 +0100 (CET)","by mail-oa0-f61.google.com with SMTP id i1sf422392oag.6 for <anything@michielbdejong.com>; Wed, 30 Oct 2013 21:25:38 -0700 (PDT)","by 10.49.24.233 with SMTP id x9ls741158qef.46.gmail; Wed, 30 Oct 2013 21:25:37 -0700 (PDT)"],"x-virus-scanned":"Debian amavisd-new at mfilter28-d.gandi.net","dkim-signature":["v=1; a=rsa-sha256; c=relaxed/relaxed; d=googlegroups.com; s=20120806; h=date:from:to:message-id:subject:mime-version:x-original-sender :reply-to:precedence:mailing-list:list-id:list-post:list-help :list-archive:sender:list-subscribe:list-unsubscribe:content-type :content-transfer-encoding; bh=1MejApS/ONJ3czMLt8VhodF8NQoFmAetqbd+97vemzI=; b=D5XOEepjXnZl5EPk8rW/kxWodu0Prol5dVwCugH+/+0qHd9XJjqgf6GRvboEY3+85L 6V5KQOAhveotiuU0W6fnVps5nO2TqCyFGNiGKmnOMrOYsETBX995VOvFqXqlGPUyr13Z NnEpfNyMkTPAZ5tkZ8QRXelU5Msu/r8EtVnfJXmBo4ivom8qsMfRs3jhKPJu+CyTTIcJ AKhQGgsnqTAmTEXGUGkjUf7I1h+OEUsVwN2bETOG8hLNy67fxtPYEVvNRbir0eX+oreD f/NlAi48OpqIX7di+a8lSkJ0Ep4g1WX2FksdS+5YWUcuL+yhylNmsteE9CPPTD0el5e/ 2qYA==","v=1; a=rsa-sha256; c=relaxed/relaxed; d=gmail.com; s=20120113; h=date:from:to:message-id:subject:mime-version:x-original-sender :reply-to:precedence:mailing-list:list-id:list-post:list-help :list-archive:sender:list-subscribe:list-unsubscribe:content-type :content-transfer-encoding; bh=1MejApS/ONJ3czMLt8VhodF8NQoFmAetqbd+97vemzI=; b=n77CGPVsHMa3sY4nHx+v/D5pVrjFganfHGkIab7SUJOYe5v56212V6kaPr0XoSW3Au 36Eti/4P5UBskGhxlSc8uzfTAuGCUJV7mZNrYU4S5w/Ss6X+OKHxRjz8FaSbv5FuUETE dxQqyYaENHRoumGvZjZu6Hfl+15a2iX3GAIjZhhqjv/6WBJac5l3NzBBc8YZuN+pW/Ns CLZG92OkWNj79UHSx2YBK2hrozPOD6XDBPiNa73YkPCRb2EkMYGJWRzDY/wtbNOR7xMe GOWO8rOv2JaJ/rmiAJ4mOJ4NAU5l1lo1LRz0hmu2UIO3fiC+oFGe56937aZ8w/OVFRtE iuxA=="],"x-received":["by 10.49.48.38 with SMTP id i6mr28724qen.4.1383193538046; Wed, 30 Oct 2013 21:25:38 -0700 (PDT)","by 10.49.71.230 with SMTP id y6mr80qeu.17.1383193537605; Wed, 30 Oct 2013 21:25:37 -0700 (PDT)"],"x-beenthere":"tosdr@googlegroups.com","date":"Wed, 30 Oct 2013 21:25:37 -0700 (PDT)","from":"\"Annie C.
