The rights you grant in this license are for the limited\n    purpose of operating, promoting, and improving our Services,\n    and to develop new ones.\n\n↑ This is a well known principle: “purpose limitation” for data\n(see\nhttps://groups.google.com/d/msg/tosdr/lU-QhFXMOcU/k5kxA_OAyPAJ )\nThe aim of such limitation is to make sure the data you provide\nwill be used for what the users want, not for something else.\n\nBut the problem is that the license is granted for all Google\nservices, including \"new\" services, i.e. services that do not\nexist yet at the time the user signs up.\n\nThese different services are not clearly identified. Google has a\nlot of services that the user might not be aware of, or might not\nwant to use.\n\nThis is very clear in the case of services which do not exist yet.\nBy definition, the user cannot know about them. So that means your\ndata could be used in the future for something completely\ndifferent!\n\nTo some people, that might ring a bell:\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_Buzz#Privacy\nLet me quote the wikipedia article:\n\n     In the announcement, the FTC agreed with the EPIC complaint\n     that Google had violated its privacy policies by using\n     information provided for Gmail for another purpose - social\n     networking - without obtaining consumers’ permission in\n     advance. \n\nThere you have it. With the new privacy policy, it looks like the\nsame mistake that caused major privacy implications would now be\nallowed, because supposedly the user has give his/her consent (by\nagreeing the content may be used for all services and for future\nservices as well). Google would NOT have to ask for your consent\nagain in the future. So you're giving “carte blanche” to Google in\na way.\n\nWe think it's not appropriate.\n\nBest,\nHugo\n\n-- \nHugo Roy, Project Lead\nTerms of Service; Didn't Read | www.tosdr.org\n\n-- \ntosdr.org | twitter.com/tosdr | github.com/tosdr\n--- \nYou received this message because you are subscribed to the Google Groups \"Terms of Service; Didn't Read\" group.\nTo unsubscribe from this group and stop receiving emails from it, send an email to tosdr+unsubscribe@googlegroups.com.\nTo post to this group, send email to tosdr@googlegroups.com.\nVisit this group at http://groups.google.com/group/tosdr?hl=en.\nFor more options, visit https://groups.google.com/groups/opt_out.\n\n\n",
