This license continues even if you stop\n    using our Services (for example, for a business listing you\n    have added to Google Maps). Some Services may offer you ways\n    to access and remove content that has been provided to that\n    Service. Also, in some of our Services, there are terms or\n    settings that narrow the scope of our use of the content\n    submitted in those Services. […]\n\nFor some services, as indicated, it might makes sense. But I doubt\nthat it really makes sense for all services. The fact that by\ndefault Google's keeping the right to use your content even if you\nstop using the service is a source of worries, especially wince\ncontent can be used by other Google services you might not be\naware of.\n\nI suppose the other way around would be more fair towards the\nuser.\n\n\nSo, how should we sum up this? I propose:\n\n    Google keeps the rights on your content when you stop using it\n\n    The license that you grant to Google on content you upload to\n    their services will continue even if you stop using the\n    services. While this makes sense for some services (e.g.\n    Google Maps) this applies by default to all Google services.\n    Otherwise you need to check each service for ways to remove\n    content and for specific clauses that restrict the license in\n    time.\n\ntopic: http://tosdr.org/topics.html#leave\nscore: -15\n\n\n-- \nHugo Roy, Project Lead\nTerms of Service; Didn't Read | www.tosdr.org\n\n-- \ntosdr.org | twitter.com/tosdr | github.com/tosdr\n--- \nYou received this message because you are subscribed to the Google Groups \"Terms of Service; Didn't Read\" group.\nTo unsubscribe from this group and stop receiving emails from it, send an email to tosdr+unsubscribe@googlegroups.com.\nTo post to this group, send email to tosdr@googlegroups.com.\nVisit this group at http://groups.google.com/group/tosdr?hl=en.\nFor more options, visit https://groups.google.com/groups/opt_out.\n\n\n",
