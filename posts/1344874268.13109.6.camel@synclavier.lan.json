  "text": "Regarding suspension and termination of users' account: we would like to\ncompare GitHub and Steam. Hopefully this discussion could help us draw a\nline between what's merely a practice not really fair for the user, and\nwhat's really unacceptable.\n\nHave a look at http://tos-dr.info/topics.html#suspension\n\nWe have\n        50 Steam: Valve can cancel your account at any time.   \n        \n        Section 10:C “Valve may cancel your Account or any particular\n        Subscription(s) at any time. In the event that your Account or a\n        particular Subscription is terminated or cancelled by Valve for\n        a violation of this Agreement or improper or illegal activity,\n        no refund, including of any Subscription fees, will be granted.”\n        \nand, we have\n        130 Github: Your account can be suspended and your data deleted\n        any time   \n        \n        “GitHub, in its sole discretion, has the right to suspend or\n        terminate your account and refuse any and all current or future\n        use of the Service, or any other GitHub service, for any reason\n        at any time. Such termination of the Service will result in the\n        deactivation or deletion of your Account or your access to your\n        Account, and the forfeiture and relinquishment of all Content in\n        your Account. GitHub reserves the right to refuse service to\n        anyone for any reason at any time. ”\n        \nSo far, I see two important differences:\n      * Github's for *any reason* while Steam does not state so (does it\n        elsewhere?). This leads us to ask a question: what does it mean\n        for Steam? If they cancel your account for unvalid reason: what\n        can the user do?\n      * Github can delete your data, while Steam merely is about\n        cancelling the account. It was pointed out that GitHub is based\n        on Git which is distributed, so no important data would be lost.\n        But I disagree with this, as GitHub is way larger than just a\n        git repo hosting.\n-- \nHugo Roy \n  French Coordinator, FSFE       chat: hugo@jabber.fsfe.org\n  www.fsfe.org/about/roy         mobile: +336 08 74 13 41\n                                 mobile DE: +49 151 143 56 563\n\n-- \nwww.tos-dr.info // www.twitter.com/tosdr // www.github.com/Unhosted/ToS-DR\n--- \nYou received this message because you are subscribed to the Google Groups \"Terms of Service; Didn't Read\" group.\nTo post to this group, send email to tosdr@googlegroups.com.\nTo unsubscribe from this group, send email to tosdr+unsubscribe@googlegroups.com.\nVisit this group at http://groups.google.com/group/tosdr?hl=en.\nFor more options, visit https://groups.google.com/groups/opt_out.\n\n\n",
