{"text":"\n\n\n-------- Message d'origine --------\nDe : Marcia Hoffman | EFF <membership@eff.org>\nEnvoyé: Tue Apr 30 22:10:28 UTC+02:00 2013\nÀ : hugo@fsfe.org\nObjet : The new \"Who Has Your Back?\" report is out!\n\nDear Friend of Digital Freedom,\nI'm excited to announce the latest update to our annual \"Who Has Your Back?\" privacy report! [https://www.eff.org/who-has-your-back-2013?support_whyb=1]\n\nWhen you use the Internet, companies ask you to trust them with your private data: from personal messages, to search terms, to photos, and much more. But government officials increasingly ask companies to hand that data over, a fact highlighted by the recent battle over CISPA.\n\nTo make \"Who Has Your Back?\", EFF lawyers and activists review company policies and interview legal departments to find out exactly how companies deal with government requests for your data. We review their answers and give stars to companies with industry-leading policies and practices, which helps privacy-conscious users make informed decisions and encourages the companies to step it up.\n\nBut the real power behind \"Who Has Your Back?\" comes from you. EFF's strong and principled community pushes companies to take privacy seriously, and after three years, we're proud to report that even more companies have moved towards instituting best practices when it comes to standing up for users’ privacy from the government.\n\nWe’re proud to be fighting for users’ rights, made possible by donations from individuals like you. Please consider supporting projects like \"Who Has Your Back?\" by joining EFF today!
