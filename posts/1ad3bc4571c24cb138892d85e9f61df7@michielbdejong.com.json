For instance, user 1 could upload a copyrighted file, and then user 2 publishes a link to it on a searchable forum. Through this clause, user 1 would be responsible for the behavior of user 2, and moreover, if the copyright owner decides to sue Mega (which they shouldn't, they should probably only sue user 2 and send a removal request to the forum), then user 1 has to pay for the legal fees of Mega.\n\nthis means that through no fault of their own, user 1 could suddenly have to pay a lot of money to Mega.\n\nYou may hope that this clause never comes into effect, but that is only hope. the truth is that as a Mega user you are agreeing that you may have to pay a lot of money to Mega, even if you were not the person who got them into trouble.\n\nwhat do other people think of this? i think this clause is really quite heavy, and goes a lot further than the more standard 'you will indemnify us if you broke these terms' clause that many other services have.\n\n-- \ntosdr.org | twitter.com/tosdr | github.com/tosdr\n--- You received this message because you are subscribed to the Google Groups \"Terms of Service; Didn't Read\" group.\nTo unsubscribe from this group and stop receiving emails from it, send an email to tosdr+unsubscribe@googlegroups.com.\nTo post to this group, send email to tosdr@googlegroups.com.\nVisit this group at http://groups.google.com/group/tosdr?hl=en.\nFor more options, visit https://groups.google.com/groups/opt_out.\n\n\n",
