  "quoteText": "Except as provided herein, if we cannot resolve a dispute informally, any dispute will be resolved only by binding arbitration to be held in the U.S.\nstate in which you reside.\nFor residents outside the United States, arbitration shall be initiated in San Francisco, California.\nDiscord and you further agree to submit to the personal jurisdiction of any state or federal court in San Francisco, California to compel arbitration, stay proceedings pending arbitration, or to confirm, modify, vacate, or enter judgment on the award entered by the arbitrator.</p>\n<p> The arbitration shall be conducted by a single arbitrator, governed by the rules of JAMS that are in effect at the time the arbitration is initiated (referred to as the “JAMS Rules”) and under the rules set forth in these Terms.\nIf there is a conflict between the JAMS Rules and the rules set forth in these Terms, the rules set forth in these Terms will govern.\nARBITRATION MEANS THAT YOU WAIVE YOUR RIGHT TO A JURY TRIAL.\nYou may, in arbitration, seek any and all remedies otherwise available to you pursuant to your state’s law.</p>\n<p> To the extent the filing fee for the arbitration exceeds the cost of filing a lawsuit, Discord will pay the additional cost.\nDiscord shall also bear the cost of any arbitration fees, unless the arbitrator finds your claims, defenses, or other fee-generating activity to be asserted or conducted for an improper purpose or frivolous.\nYou are responsible for all other additional costs that you may incur in the arbitration including, without limitation, attorney’s fees and expert witness costs unless Discord is specifically required to pay such fees under applicable law.\nThe decision of the arbitrator will be in writing and binding and conclusive on Discord and you, and judgment to enforce the decision may be entered by any court of competent jurisdiction.\nDiscord and you agree that dispositive motions, including without limitation motions to dismiss and motions for summary judgment, will be allowed in the arbitration.\nThe arbitrator must follow these Terms of Service and can award the same damages and relief as a court, including injunctive or other equitable relief and attorney’s fees.\nDiscord and you understand that, absent this mandatory arbitration provision, Discord and you would have the right to sue in court and have a jury trial.\nDiscord and you further understand that, in some instances, the costs of arbitration could exceed the costs of litigation and that the right to discovery may be more limited in arbitration than in court.</p>\n<p> If Discord’s or your claim is solely for monetary relief of $10,000 or less and does not include a request for any type of equitable remedy, the party bringing the claim may choose whether the arbitration of the claim will be conducted, through a telephonic hearing, or by an in-person hearing under the JAMS Rules, solely based on documents submitted to the arbitrator.\nYou or Discord may choose to pursue a claim in small claims court where jurisdiction and venue over you and Discord otherwise qualifies for such small claims court and where the claim does not include a request for any type of equitable relief.\nHowever, if you decide to pursue a claim in small claims court, you agree to still provide Discord with advance notice by email to disputes@discord.com and by U.S.\nMail to Discord Inc., 444 De Haro Street #200, San Francisco, CA 94107.",
