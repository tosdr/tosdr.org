However, accounts maintain their ID numbers (shown in the URL) and all of the account's undeleted posts, deleted post history, tag edits, wiki edits, unhidden comments, et cetera will remain visible to all users.\r\n\r\nUpdate: As of March 2020, the site has been revamped with a new backend software and now allows users to delete their accounts.
