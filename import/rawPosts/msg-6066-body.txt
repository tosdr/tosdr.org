Hi Kyle,

Firstly, thank you for your contribution! However, in the future we'd appre=
ciate if you followed the guidelines at https://tosdr.org/get-involved.html.=
 As you can imagine, there's lots of information in terms of service and pr=
ivacy policies, but contributing according to the link above helps us keep =
track of each data point a little more easily.

Best,
Ian
