Firstly, I should reiterate that although we are providing this service, no=
ne of this is legal advice. So as far as any legal consequences for having =
an empty terms of service, my only response to that would be to consult a l=
awyer.

Certainly the country in which you host the service will have some bearing =
on your TOS, since there different laws in different countries regarding on=
line services. As far as I know, many of those laws deal with privacy and u=
ser ownership issues.

As far as my comment, I just imagine something simple, like a site that hos=
ts photos. Let's say your only goal of the site is to provide a cloud servi=
ce for people to host their photos and search for others based on any tags.=
 Basically, I'm thinking of something between Pinterest/Flickr. If you have=
 an empty TOS, users can search and download and manipulate other the photo=
s of other users who may not want that. Without a TOS, it's difficult to te=
ll where fault lies.

That might not be a great example, but it's just off the top of my head. :)
