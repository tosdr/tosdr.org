For what it's worth, after the Supreme Court's ruling in *AT&T Mobility LLC 
v. Concepcion* (2011), these sorts of clauses are much, much more common. 
Before 2011, some states disfavored class waivers and found them 
unconscionable, and California even had a state law invalidating class 
action waivers like this. But the Supreme Court held that the Federal 
Arbitration Act preempted California's law and permitted class action 
waivers. Since 2011, many companies have started adding waivers into their 
contracts.

While I agree that it's bad and negatively affects the consumer, it is 
becoming standard, and is supported by the Supreme Court.

What I suggest, then, is rather than flagging all class action waiver 
clauses as bad (because as they become more and more standard, we'll end up 
flagging *all* of them as bad, and ultimately providing no useful data to 
readers), we instead alert readers about a class action waiver, and flag 
class action waivers with consumer-friendly provisions as neutral (less 
bad?), while flagging class action waivers with consumer-unfriendly 
provisions as bad. This, at least, would allow readers to understand the 
agreements they're making a little better.

<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; Initiation of Arbitration Proceeding/Selection of Arbitra=
tor.
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; If you or the Sony Entity you have a Dispute with elect t=
o
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; resolve your Dispute through arbitration, the party initi=
ating
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; the arbitration proceeding may initiate it with the Ameri=
can
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; Arbitration Association ("AAA"), <a href=3D"http://www.ad=
r.org" target=3D"_blank">www.adr.org</a>, or JAMS
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; <a href=3D"http://www.jamsadr.com" target=3D"_blank">www.=
jamsadr.com</a>. The terms of this Section 17 govern in the
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; event they conflict with the rules of the arbitration
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; organization selected by the parties.
<br>
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; Arbitration Procedures. Because the software and/or servi=
ce
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; provided to you by the Sony Entity you have a Dispute wit=
h
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; concern interstate commerce, the Federal Arbitration Act
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; ("FAA") governs the arbitrability of all Disputes. Howeve=
r,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; applicable federal or state law may also apply to the
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; substance of any Disputes. For claims of less than $75,00=
0,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; the AAA's Supplementary Procedures for Consumer-Related
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; Disputes ("Supplementary Procedures") shall apply includi=
ng
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; the schedule of arbitration fees set forth in Section C-8=
 of
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; the Supplementary Procedures; for claims over $75,000, th=
e
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; AAA's Commercial Arbitration Rules and relevant fee sched=
ules
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; for non-class action proceedings shall apply. The AAA rul=
es
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; are available at <a href=3D"http://www.adr.org" target=3D=
"_blank">www.adr.org</a> or by calling 1-800-778-7879.
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; Further, if your claims do not exceed $75,000 and you pro=
vided
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; notice to and negotiated in good faith with the Sony Enti=
ty
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; you had a Dispute with as described above, if the arbitra=
tor
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; finds that you are the prevailing party in the arbitratio=
n,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; you will be entitled to recover reasonable attorneys' fee=
s and
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; costs as determined by the arbitrator, in addition to any
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; rights to recover the same under controlling state or fed=
eral
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; law afforded to the Sony Entity you have a Dispute with o=
r
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; you. The arbitrator will make any award in writing but ne=
ed
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; not provide a statement of reasons unless requested by a
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; party. Such award will be binding and final, excerpt for =
any
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; right of appeal provided by the FAA, and may be entered i=
n any
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; court having jurisdiction over the parties for purposes o=
f
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; enforcement.
<br>
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; Location of Arbitration. You or the Sony Entity you have =
a
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; Dispute with may initiate arbitration in either San Mateo
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; County, California or the United States county in which y=
ou
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; reside. In the event that you select the county of your U=
nited
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; States residence, the Sony Entity you have a Dispute with=
 may
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; transfer the arbitration to San Mateo, County in the even=
t
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; that it agrees to pay any additional fees or costs you in=
cur
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; as a result of the change in location as determined by th=
e
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; arbitrator.
<br>
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; Severability. If any clause within this Section 17 (other=
 than
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; the Class Action Waiver clause above) is found to be ille=
gal
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; or unenforceable, that clause will be severed from this
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; Section 17, and the remainder of this Section 17 will be =
given
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; full force and effect. If the Class Action Waiver clause =
is
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; found to be illegal or unenforceable, this entire Section=
 17
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; will be unenforceable, and the Dispute will be decided by=
 a
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; court and you and the Sony Entity you have a dispute with=
 each
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; agree to waive in that instance, to the fullest extent al=
lowed
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; by law, any trial by jury.
<br>
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; Continuation. This Section 17 shall survive any terminati=
on of
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; this Agreement or the provision of SEN First Party Servic=
es to
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; you.
