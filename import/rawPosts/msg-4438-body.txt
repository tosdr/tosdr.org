Hi Eric,

I've looked at the forum. What you posted there could have been
posted here too, that would be the process: people post what they
find by email and then we collectively review them on the list. 

Please tell us what was not clear in
https://tosdr.org/get-involved.html

Can you explain a bit more where your frustration comes from using
https://tosdr.org/topics.html ? This shouldn't frustrate
contributors like you, so there' something wrong that we need to
fix. However if you don't give us more details on what's bothering
you exactly, we can't improve it.

I hope you understand.

We'll include your contributions ourselves if you decide not to
post them to the mailing-list.

Thanks,
Hugo
