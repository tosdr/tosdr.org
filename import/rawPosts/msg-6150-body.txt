Here's what I'd propose for this point:

Title: You only license, not own, Kindle content

Topic: Suspension and censorship

Summary: Although you may buy content for your Kindle, that price is=20
actually just the price you pay to license that content. You don't own it.=
=20
A harsh example of this truth occurred in October 2012: Linn Nygaard=20
purchased a Kindle in the UK and then returned to her home in Norway, and=
=20
continued to use her Kindle, buying books from Amazon's UK store. After=20
working fine for some time, Nygaard's Kindle developed a technical problem,=
=20
and she called Amazon's customer service to get it replaced. Amazon then=20
closed her account and deleted all her content, and would not even explain=
=20
to her why until her story got significant media attention -- once the bad=
=20
press started building up, Amazon reinstated her account and restored her=
=20
content.

Score: 50 (alert)
