"Visitors may [...] send e-cards [...] so long as the content [...] 
does not consist of [...] political campaigning"
https://github.com/tosdr/tosback2/blob/265e49bf24a91076495ce1fddf279c4638421a66/crawl/amazon.com/Conditions%20of%20Use.txt#L80

maybe i misunderstood what they mean with political campaigning here, 
but they make it sound like
selling viagra. This very post I'm sending to the tosdr mailing list 
here could be called political
campaigning. does that mean i cannot discuss political topics in 
e-cards sent via Amazon or in reviews
of books on Amazon? How are you supposed to review a political book, 
then?

the rest of the list (software viruses, commercial solicitation, chain 
letters, mass mailings) sounds
reasonable, it seems the "political campaigning" clause slipped in 
there as a too wide concept, based on
some more specific spam example.
