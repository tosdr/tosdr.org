I personally feel that until this kind of clause/practice is made clear to =
lay people, that we should flag it as important to the user. I'd rather con=
tinually flag than just assume users understood, although with the recent o=
utcry against Microsoft's Xbox One licensing of games, I'm hoping that this=
 kind of thing will be more prevalent in the eyes of the public when it com=
es to digital media.

hose titles from users' Kindle archives. When users protested, Amazon resto=
red the titles to the Kindle archives for those users who had already purch=
ased them, and called it a "technical issue."</div><div><br></div><div>Two =
years later, in October 2012, <a href=3D"http://boingboing.net/2012/10/22/k=
indle-user-claims-amazon-dele.html" target=3D"_blank">it happened again</a>=
: Linn Nygaard purchased a Kindle in the UK and then returned to her home i=
n Norway, and continued to use her Kindle, buying books from Amazon's UK st=
ore. After working fine for some time, Nygaard's Kindle developed a technic=
al problem, and she called Amazon's customer service to get it replaced. Am=
azon then closed her account and deleted all her content, and would not eve=
n explain to her why until her story got significant media attention -- onc=
e the bad press started building up, Amazon <a href=3D"http://digitaljourna=
l.com/article/335484" target=3D"_blank">reinstated her account and restored=
 her content</a>.</div><div><br></div><div>So...short version: Amazon has a=
lready been sued about this, and has promised in court that it would severe=
ly restrict its ability to delete content on users' Kindles. <i>That hasn't=
 stopped Amazon from deleting content on users' Kindles in ways not covered=
 by the settlement.</i></div><div><br></div><div>The bigger issue, as I men=
tioned above, is the license vs. sale issue for digital goods. Unfortunatel=
y, after 2010's <i>Vernor v. Autodesk</i>&nbsp;decision, courts support thi=
s structure. It means that no, you don't generally own the content you buy =
online. You don't own the copies of the songs you buy on iTunes. You don't =
own the copies of games you download off Steam. That's what your end user <=
i>license</i>&nbsp;agreement is telling you:&nbsp;you license them, which b=
asically means you're just borrowing them.</div><div><br></div><div>In term=
s of ToS:DR, it's something you can flag if you want to, because it's somet=
hing people <i>should</i>&nbsp;care about...but it's how <i>everything</i>&=
nbsp;is done. Digital content is almost always licensed, not sold -- to fin=
d copies actually, explicitly <i>sold</i>&nbsp;online is the exception, rat=
her than the rule. It's another of those situations where red-flagging <i>e=
verything</i>&nbsp;will end up giving the user less information, not more.<=

<br>&gt; i guess for physical reading material it's the difference we all
<br>&gt; understand between reading a newspaper in a cafe or library and
<br>&gt; buying that same newspaper at a kiosk, but in the case of electron=
ic
<br>&gt; content, how is this different in practice?
<br>
<br>Yes, that means you don't own anything.
<br>
<br>It would be like when you go to a physical library and they make
<br>you sign an agreement saying: "we're not selling this to you". So
<br>if you don't own it, you don't have property rights on it=85 Bad for
<br>you.
<br>
<br>For instance, if I own something it means I can resell it second
<br>hands. Here, I can't.
