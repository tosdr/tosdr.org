I'm not able, right now, to find the thread where I went into detail about=
=20
class action waivers, but the important part of it is that the court case=
=20
that changed everything was *AT&T Mobility v. Concepcion* in 2011. Before=
=20
that, you didn't generally see class action waivers in terms of service,=20
because some states didn't allow them -- most notably, California had a law=
=20
specifically banning arbitration agreements with class action waivers. *AT&=
T=20
Mobility v. Concepcion* struck down the California test, and all of a=20
sudden we're seeing class action waivers in terms of service. ....Ever=20
since 2011. ...Which means that in 2009, when *this* suit was initiated=20
against Amazon, there weren't class action waivers in terms of service. See=
?

I agree: the difference between a license and a sale is an extremely=20
crucial one. It's one that I do think users should be fighting over. When=
=20
you buy a hard copy of a book, it is yours and you have the right to=20
dispose of it however you see fit, under the first sale doctrine. When you=
=20
buy a digital copy of a book, it is absurd that you only license it and=20
have no rights to it. But it's one that you'll find yourself flagging every=
=20
time you see a license agreement, and as with many things, the exact=20
wording of the license agreement matters so much.

I think your proposed write-up for this point is a good one. I suggest=20
linking to https://www.eff.org/issues/digital-books=20
and https://www.eff.org/issues/drm as well.

till not own it. Hugo, didn't you post an article where someone had their a=
ccount closed and Kindle content deleted without explanation?<br><br>On Wed=

<br>&gt; i'm pretty sure this means something, just not sure what exactly. =

<br>&gt; i guess for physical reading material it's the difference we all
<br>&gt; understand between reading a newspaper in a cafe or library and
<br>&gt; buying that same newspaper at a kiosk, but in the case of electron=
ic
<br>&gt; content, how is this different in practice?
<br>
<br>Yes, that means you don't own anything.
<br>
<br>It would be like when you go to a physical library and they make
<br>you sign an agreement saying: "we're not selling this to you". So
<br>if you don't own it, you don't have property rights on it=85 Bad for
<br>you.
<br>
<br>For instance, if I own something it means I can resell it second
<br>hands. Here, I can't.
