Agreed. I also wonder specifically how they'd notify users because just 
posting the new TOS on the services isn't good enough, in my opinion. Is 
their notification posted on the page of the TOS, in which case users have 
to periodically check that page? Or would users receive an email saying the 
terms will be updating in X days/weeks, please review?
