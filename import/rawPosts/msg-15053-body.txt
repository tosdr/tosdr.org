Title: [Bad] Cannot sue Gittip for breach of ToS or misuse of payment card =
information or submissions
Topic: waiver
Summary: This is standard hold harmless language, with addition of a clause=
 protecting against any possible violation of PCI rules.
Score: 25

> You agree to defend, indemnify and hold harmless Gittip, its independent =
contractors, service providers and consultants, and their respective direct=
ors, employees and agents, from and against any claims, damages, costs, lia=
bilities and expenses (including, but not limited to, reasonable attorneys'=
 fees) arising out of or related to (a) any actual or alleged breach of the=
se Terms, the Terms of Service, or any other Gittip agreement, policy or gu=
ideline (b) any actual or alleged violation of applicable laws or rules of =
any payment card association, network or company; (c) your wrongful or impr=
oper use of the Site; (d) any Submission or transaction submitted by you; o=
r (e) your violation of the rights of any third party.

Discussion:

I mark this as "bad" because Gittip is essentially not taking any responsib=
ility for misuse of credit card information. Fortunately for Gittip, all of=
 its payment information is kept by a third party. With that in mind, it ma=
y be wise for Gittip to state that fact somehow.
