Thank you very much for this thoughtful response. That makes sense. Maybe 
one day I'll get organized and will use github to create a k-12 partner 
to ToS;DR.org. Or maybe Common Sense Media or its new Graphite spinoff will 
start filling that role.

Best,

Jonathan

<br>&gt; Are you sure you want to leave this info out of your reviews?
<br>
<br>Yes, but this is up for debate. My opinion on this right now is:
<br>
<br>&nbsp;- most people using these services wouldn't care about that, so
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp;adding this information is not necessarily relevant; and
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp;everything not relevant that we add diminishes the attenti=
on
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp;spent on more relevant points, so we try to stick to the m=
ost
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp;important.
<br>&nbsp;- if you're a parent or a teacher, then you're very concerned
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp;with this: it does not take a lot of time to find out for
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp;yourself in the terms of service whether or not your less =
than
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp;13yo kid can use the service. So I think there's little va=
lue
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp;that ToS;DR can bring you here, whereas ToS;DR does bring =
a lot
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp;of value for all the other more complex and legal issues.
<br>
<br>Now, I'm concerned about getting the ToS;DR.org community focused.
<br>But there's nothing preventing another organisation, focused on
<br>education, to work with us and use the same code, so they can add
<br>the age limit information and look for it themselves. Anyone can
<br>start a project focused on age limits for websites and if they use
<br>a compatible format (see our code on <a href=3D"http://github.com/tosdr=
" target=3D"_blank">github.com/tosdr</a>) this
<br>information could be integrated in the web browser extension.
<br>
<br>I hope this explains my reasons.
<br>
<br>(Plus, how would we rate these age limits? To me, it looks like
