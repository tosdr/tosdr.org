I don't think we can make such specific guidelines yet. And
considering the complexity of the subject, I don't think it's
realistic to expect that if 2 persons do the same service, we end
up with the same result. That's why we take a different approach
to start: we discuss each specific cases until we reach a point
where there's enough data on a topic to make it easy to have
guidelines. So it's more of a bottom-up approach rather than top
down.

Where do you see lack of consistency in ToS;DR? Nothing is set in
stone, all we have to do is continue reviewing and adjust things
on and on as we get more data. This is how we'll reach
consistency that makes sense. 

If we impose consistency by defining arbitrarily cases before we
get a good grasp at the whole complexity of them, I think that's
where we'll have a less useful ToS;DR.

But that takes time, effort and, patience.

Because there may be important differences.

 - A choice of jurisdiction clause means: a judge in this legal area
will be competent to judge this case.

 - A choice of law clause means: any judge (in any area) who's
dealing with this case will have to use this law to make the case.

For the Court of law/jurisdiction, I suppose they're similar so
they should be phrased the same way. We just have to modify it
now, no big deal. If the clauses are identical, we can also simply
merge them in the same point (but there might be differences,
explaining why we keep them separate).

Sure, but that's alright! No one person can get everything right.
That's why we use this group to discuss everything. Don't be
afraid of posting things even if you're not sure. It does do any
harm to tosdr.org quite the contrary :)

(You can set your preferences in google group to only receive
emails you contributed to, etc. so you don't have to follow up,
you just get answers in your inbox)

We'll do.

Thanks for your contribution,
