<br>&gt; I see I have run into a hornet's nest while trying to explain an e=

<br>&gt; feature of US law.=20
<br>
<br>Not at all. I am just trying to keep the discussion here focused
<br>on what we discuss: terms of service, and their implications on
<br>users.
<br>
<br>I have read your email, and I do not understand: what's your point
<br>concretely?
<br>
<br>DMCA creates liability or hosts that don't take-down content after
<br>receiving a notice making them aware of the alleged infringement.
<br>
<br>In response, hosts create rules to handle the removal of content;
<br>these procedures have an impact on users, because it is about
<br>users' data.
<br>
<br>Hence it is important for our point of view to have a clear
<br>understanding on the ToS to understand how they impact users'
<br>data.=20
<br>
<br>If we want to understand it, we obviously have to understand that
<br>hosts are exposed to these liabilities. But DMCA or copyright in
<br>general should not be an excuse for theses services to let users
<br>down when they're doing something licit.=20
<br>
<br>Are you saying that it's always impossible for the host to see if
<br>something is obviously licit or not? And that because of this,
<br>hosts should always take down content after notice and do nothing
<br>else? &nbsp;Because this is how your email reads to me.
<br>
<br>The NASA example is exactly about DMCA-liability-style take-down
<br>notices making an host (YouTube) remove content, whereas the
<br>action of the user was perfectly lawful (NASA footage is public
<br>domain).
<br>
<br>So, yes, in my opinion, such cases where the user should prevail
<br>and get their data back online are a reality; terms which
<br>acknowledge that reality and offer good hosting ToS to their
<br>users should get a + on <a href=3D"https://tosdr.org" target=3D"_blank">=
tosdr.org</a>
<br>
<br>If I misunderstood what you were trying to say, I am sorry; but
<br>you're not making things easy when you're not quoting which parts
<br>of my arguments you disagree on exactly.
<br>
<br>If anyone wants to read the dropbox terms related to this, as the
<br>first person posting on this subject did:
