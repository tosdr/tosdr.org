I've looked at 10 different services so far and posted my findings to 
https://forum.quantifiedself.com/forum-data-ownership-privacy. I'd love to 
have this information be part of ToS:DR eventually, but find the process 
and lack of clear guidelines for reviewing terms using the existing 
"categories" and "topics" too frustrating and time-consuming.
