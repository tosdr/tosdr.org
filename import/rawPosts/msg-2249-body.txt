Ian, thanks a lot for your answers and I apologize if this looks like 
asking for legal advice.
Let's stick to the more tos;dr question, which is also the one I am more 
interested about.
Again, suppose I start a service on the lines of your or Vinayak's 
examples. 
How would you rate that on tos;dr?
I want to understand if my laziness would pay back. Will I end up with an A 
or a B (as Michiel conjectures)? If I end up with an E on tos;dr, then it's 
better if I sit down and start to write the tos page :P

Alessandro
