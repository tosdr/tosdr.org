 don't have a ruling that gives users any new rights. Under the terms of th=
e settlement, Amazon agreed that it would not remotely delete works from Ki=
ndles unless the user agrees to the deletion; the user fails to pay for the=
 book; a court or other regulatory order requires deletion; or deletion is =
necessary to protect consumers from malicious code.<div><br></div><div>A ye=
ar later, in December 2010, Amazon got into trouble <i>again</i>&nbsp;for <=
a href=3D"http://arstechnica.com/business/2010/12/amazons-latest-kindle-del=
etion-erotic-incest-themed-fiction/" target=3D"_blank">deleting a whole bun=
ch of erotica titles from its store</a>...and also deleting those titles fr=
om users' Kindle archives. When users protested, Amazon restored the titles=
 to the Kindle archives for those users who had already purchased them, and=
 called it a "technical issue."</div><div><br></div><div>Two years later, i=
n October 2012, <a href=3D"http://boingboing.net/2012/10/22/kindle-user-cla=
ims-amazon-dele.html" target=3D"_blank">it happened again</a>: Linn Nygaard=
 purchased a Kindle in the UK and then returned to her home in Norway, and =
continued to use her Kindle, buying books from Amazon's UK store. After wor=
king fine for some time, Nygaard's Kindle developed a technical problem, an=
d she called Amazon's customer service to get it replaced. Amazon then clos=
ed her account and deleted all her content, and would not even explain to h=
er why until her story got significant media attention -- once the bad pres=
s started building up, Amazon <a href=3D"http://digitaljournal.com/article/=
335484" target=3D"_blank">reinstated her account and restored her content</=
a>.</div><div><br></div><div>So...short version: Amazon has already been su=
ed about this, and has promised in court that it would severely restrict it=
s ability to delete content on users' Kindles. <i>That hasn't stopped Amazo=
n from deleting content on users' Kindles in ways not covered by the settle=
ment.</i></div><div><br></div><div>The bigger issue, as I mentioned above, =
is the license vs. sale issue for digital goods. Unfortunately, after 2010'=
s <i>Vernor v. Autodesk</i>&nbsp;decision, courts support this structure. I=
t means that no, you don't generally own the content you buy online. You do=
n't own the copies of the songs you buy on iTunes. You don't own the copies=
 of games you download off Steam. That's what your end user <i>license</i>&=
nbsp;agreement is telling you:&nbsp;you license them, which basically means=
 you're just borrowing them.</div><div><br></div><div>In terms of ToS:DR, i=
t's something you can flag if you want to, because it's something people <i=
>should</i>&nbsp;care about...but it's how <i>everything</i>&nbsp;is done. =
Digital content is almost always licensed, not sold -- to find copies actua=
lly, explicitly <i>sold</i>&nbsp;online is the exception, rather than the r=
ule. It's another of those situations where red-flagging <i>everything</i>&=
nbsp;will end up giving the user less information, not more.</div><div><br>=

<br>&gt; i guess for physical reading material it's the difference we all
<br>&gt; understand between reading a newspaper in a cafe or library and
<br>&gt; buying that same newspaper at a kiosk, but in the case of electron=
ic
<br>&gt; content, how is this different in practice?
<br>
<br>Yes, that means you don't own anything.
<br>
<br>It would be like when you go to a physical library and they make
<br>you sign an agreement saying: "we're not selling this to you". So
<br>if you don't own it, you don't have property rights on it=85 Bad for
<br>you.
<br>
<br>For instance, if I own something it means I can resell it second
<br>hands. Here, I can't.
