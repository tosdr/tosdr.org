In the past, Google stated in their Privacy Policy: <em>“We strike a reasonable balance between the competing pressures we face, such as the privacy of our users, the security of our systems and the need for innovation. We believe anonymizing IP addresses after 9 months and cookies in our search engine logs after 18 months strikes the right balance”</em>. Today, these limitations of time are gone from the Privacy Policy, although <a href=\"http://support.google.com/accounts/bin/answer.py?hl=en&answer=162743\">some pages</a> still acknowledge this. So we must conclude that Google has decided to stop trying to find the right balance between privacy of users and their own needs.</p></div></li>\n<li id=\"popup-point-google-Vn7He54dnVI\" class=\"point\"><div class=\"bad\"><h5><span class=\"badge badge-warning\" title=\"bad\"><i class=\"icon-thumbs-down icon-white\">-</i></span> Google can use your content for all their existing and future services <a href=\"https://groups.google.com/d/msg/tosdr/Vn7He54dnVI/discussion\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"label context\">Discussion</a></h5><p>The content you post on a particular Google service can be used by Google on other services you may not be aware of.</p></div></li>\n<li id=\"popup-point-google-QZgR8faRWDU\" class=\"point\"><div class=\"bad\"><h5><span class=\"badge badge-warning\" title=\"bad\"><i class=\"icon-thumbs-down icon-white\">-</i></span> Google can share your personal information with other parties <a href=\"https://groups.google.com/d/topic/tosdr/QZgR8faRWDU/discussion\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"label context\">Discussion</a></h5><p>Google will share your personal information with other parties.
