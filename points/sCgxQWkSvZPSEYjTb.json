    "tldr": "The dutch newspaper of record states in its privacy policy that it complies to the current Dutch laws. For an effective way of working they use Google Analytics and they explain that Google can use and sell the information gathered with GA to third parties. The terms also explain the right of NRC to make changes in their privacy policy. On the other hand the user of their websites has the right to request insight in which data is gathered from him/her and has a right to be forgotten."
