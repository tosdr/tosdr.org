All information relating to these requests is anonymized by the authorities themselves, and they also provide spreadsheets which allow you to control how the request is approved. KolabNow also keeps a running total of the number of requests received, granted, and denied on their Privacy Policy page. The number for all was 0 as of August 1, 2013."
