    "tldr": "\"Credit Karma maintains physical, electronic, administrative and procedural safeguards intended to protect the confidentiality of Personal Information that we collect about you, including Social Security numbers. We limit access to Social Security numbers to help protect against their loss or misuse and we do not disclose Social Security numbers to third parties except where such disclosure is required or permitted by law.\"\n\nBasically, they don't intentionally share it with third parties, so it's as secure as their information security practices allow. The linked Security Practices page (https://www.creditkarma.com/about/security) is pretty generic, listing some common best practices, but not giving enough detail to reassure someone who's been following the industry's security breaches. Perhaps emailing their security team would yield more transparency."
