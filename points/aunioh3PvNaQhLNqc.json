    "tldr": "Do Not Track (“DNT”) is a privacy preference that users can set in their web browsers. DNT is a way for users to inform websites and services that they do not want certain information about their webpage visits collected over time and across websites or online services. \n\nTinder provides opt-out links instead, because they do not recognize or respond to any DNT signals, saying that the Internet industry needs to work towards defining exactly what DNT means, and what it means to comply with DNT, and finding a common approach to responding to DNT."
