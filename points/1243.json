    "tldr": "Each Sonic.net service type has an associated hosted website and media bandwidth quota. Accounts with multiple services will gain the benefit of each service's quota combined (they are cumulative). Usage during the month that is trending above the total quota (i.e. is projected to exceed the quota by the end of the month based upon the current portion of the month already passed) will generate a warning email. Additional usage beyond the quota will be billed at $4.95 per gigabyte in 1GB increments. The bandwidth quota includes bandwidth used for content you host here at Sonic.net, including web, FTP and multimedia. It does not apply to content you download to your PC via your dialup, DSL, or other Sonic.net connection."
