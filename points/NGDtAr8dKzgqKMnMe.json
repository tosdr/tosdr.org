If you win, you will be entitled to an award of attorneys' fees and expenses, and Uber will not seek, and waives all rights to recover attorneys' fees and expenses if Uber wins.  Furthermore, if your claim for damages does not exceed $75,000, Uber will pay for filing, administrative and arbitrator fees."
