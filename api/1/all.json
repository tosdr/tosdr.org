Anyone who is known or suspected to be underage will have their accounts permanently blocked, although the blocked user can send an email to the site's management to prove they are of age to visit the site if this happens. Through this method, if the administration determines that the user blocked for being underage is presently of age, then they will unblock that user's account.\r\n\r\nThis policy applies to both e621 and its \"work-safe\" database mirror e926, which only displays non-explicit images.

Arbitration is less formal than a lawsuit in court, and provides more limited discovery. It follows different rules than court proceedings, and is subject to very limited review by courts. The arbitrator will issue a written decision and provide a statement of reasons if requested by either party.
